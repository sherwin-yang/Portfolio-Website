            This project was the first collaboration project when I was in Apple
            Developer Academy. With 4 other friends, together we conducted desk
            research, wire-framing, prototyping, and develop this app in about 3
            weeks.
            <br />
            As iOS developer, I contributed to build the Onboarding Page, Report
            Page, and Detailed Report Page.
