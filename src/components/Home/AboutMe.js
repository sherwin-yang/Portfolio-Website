          I am an iOS Developer with 2+ years of professional working experience at the 
          #1 OTT platform in Indonesia. Studied Computer Science in BINUS University Jakarta

          Write my first Swift code in February 2020 when I joined Apple Developer Academy @BINUS, 
          I've developed multiple iOS/iPadOS/watchOS apps and successfully launched  
          <span class="bold-text homeplan-text-color"> Homeplan</span> to the App Store in December 2020
          which took me into the journey of joining Apple Catalyst Program to escelate the product (until August 2021).
